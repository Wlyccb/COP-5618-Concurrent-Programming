## Implement thread local variables in C++

In Java, ThreadLocal variables are provided via a class. The class has get and set methods. The initial value of a ThreadLocal variable is obtained by calling the initialValue method, which is executed the first time a get method on the variable is called by a thread, unless a set method has already been called. The method returns null, but can be overridden to behave as desired. Because ThreadLocals are classes in Java, primitive types cannot be made thread_local. There is also a remove method which removes the current thread's value for this thread-local variable.  

Thread local variables in Java and C++ are implemented by maintaining a data structure within a thread that maps threadlocal variables to the value. Whenever a thread is terminated, the threadâ€™s instances are handled according to the way things are done in that language.  

For this assignment, we are going to implement our own class to implement thread local variables in C++. There is no reason to do this rather than use the ones provided by C++, except this is an excellent exercise that also makes us aware of the underlying implementation so that we can make better cost benefit tradeoffs in using thread local variables.
